# Being Born

When I was pregnant with AnoraNisqua, my firstborn and first pregnancy, I had this strange experience where I believed I would have this magical, transcendent birth but also that I would die. Maybe because someone in my past once "prophesied" I would die during child birth, maybe because I have had a close brush with death before. I don’t know. One day I was sharing about this duality at an empathy//Non Violent Communication meetup I have attended for years. We were in pairs taking turns empathizing with one another. I was sharing with a very mild, warm soul. He has the same East Texas twang I grew up with, is tall and skinny as a rail, with a thin ponytail and bright blue eyes.  We sat outside in a backyard in Hyde Park, Austin, Texas on a sunny afternoon. I started sharing about the polarity in my visions of what giving birth would be like and he asked me a question I found surprising, " What was your birth like?" I repeated the story I've heard my whole life. Applying humor in the places it was always applied before:

My mom drove herself to the hospital. My dad was at home with my older sister who was 2 years old. (With my sister she had an emergency c-section. She had a c-section sheduled with me, however she actually went into labor the day of the scheduled surgery which I consider quite lucky for both of us. We still got some of the benefits of natural labor even though I was born via cesarean.)  Once the surgery began my mom looked up at my Aunt Becky, her sister, who was in the room with her and told her she could not breathe and she was scared. This part of the story is strangely always told with humor. The anesthesiologist was dancing around and had music playing. Aunt Becky got his attention and he came over to check my mom. Her epidural was reversed, traveling up instead of down.

My empathy partner paused me and said, "as an anesthesiologist myself, I am distracted from empathizing and want to educate, is that okay?" I said sure. Then he said, "you and your mom almost died in childbirth.'

The tears gushed.  The flowed. Then they stopped.

Then he said, "your only experience with birth so far has been a near death experience."  It sounded far out there and it also sounded true and it felt true. Empathizing with that subconscious fear was liberating and healing. I followed up with my mom about the experience and she said, with no humor, "yes it was very scary. There was a malpractice suit filed against him."  I asked why she always tells the story with humor and she said, "I just didn’t want to dwell on it." And she didn’t for thirty years.
