## Basic formatting

Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.

Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line.

Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so. ~~You can strikethrough text like this~~. Use backtics for inline monospacing `like this`.

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, for example: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.

## Lists

### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. A second item
3. A nested list
    * carrots
    * celery
    * lentils
4. Another item

### Unordered list

* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item
* And there's more...

## Block quotes

## Unicode and Emoji

Unicode is supported! Which means you can paste emojis directly like so: â˜º. Or insert them with short codes like :tada: :camel: :+1: :tada: :smile: :baby: :poop: :kiss: :joy: :palm_tree: :the_horns: Oh yeah :kissing_heart:

:shrug: :juggling:

I :heart: you.
