When someone I know announces they are pregnant I feel super excited to share everything I've learned about pregnancy, birth and parenting with them! Also, just when I see strangers that are pregnant. Don't worry, I hold back unless my advice is requested ;)

When I hear you are pregnant I first want to hug you, celebrate you and your baby, welcome you into this new tribe and this new season of life. I want to hold space for you and let you know I am here to support you and hold your hand and cheer you on and listen to you as you make your journey into motherhood. I want to tell you everything I have learned in hopes that it will contribute and enrich your pregnancy, your birth, and your parenting journey. I want you to have the best experience you can and enjoy the ride!

Why? What does it do for me? It meets my need for contribution, for closeness, for community. If there are more mamas in the world having beautiful experiences with pregnany and birth and parenting there will be more children in the world growing up with their needs met, happy and healthy and empowered and loved. There will be less suffering for families, for mamas, for babies. I want to contribute to birth and postpartum bliss. I've experienced the bliss and I've observed the flip side of the suffering that comes when pregnancy, birth and parenting are soured with trauma. I want to contribute to your experience being as blisful and as empowered as possible. My intention is to provide information so that you can be in choice about what happens during these major milestones and that they don’t just happen to you.

Here's the nutshell version of everything I have to say to every mom to be:

- Create the birth you want!! You're responsible for your own birth. Prepare for it, take charge, run the show. No one can run a marathon for you, eat your dinner for you, get married for you, have an orgasm for you or birth your child for you. This is not something you outsource. You are the one who will feel the contractions and push your baby out or you're the one who will lie on the operating table and be cut open as your baby is born via cesarean, however it happens, it's happening to you. And when it's all said and done you're the one left to care with this new baby. The most important person in your life is now completely dependent on you so empower and educate yourself for the experience! It will be intense regardless. Go for good, euphoric, ecstatic intense. A physical and spiritual and sacred experience rather than a traumatic, haunting, physically and soul shuddering intense. Ultimately you will have to surrender to the process and it will go how it will so prepare and be in choice as much as possible before hand! Know your statistics. What are your statistics of having interventions or a c section in the place you are birthing? What are the policies of your midwife or birth center or ob//hospital? Don't be a statistic, create the birth you want. Whether you have a vaginal or cesarean birth, go in as informed and empowered as possible. Cesareans when medically necessary save lives and peaceful belly births should be optimized! They are wildly over performed though. The more you educate yourself the more you will know what your body is capable of, what is right for you and your baby and when life saving interventions should be used!

* If you are so sick during pregnancy you are nonfunctional, learn about Hypermesis Gravidarum. It is not extreme morning sickness. It is an illness that can lead to miscarriage or even maternal death and needs proper attention. http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum/

- Listen to your gut, your intuition. Think for yourself and decide what's best for your baby. Just because the culture you (and your baby) were born into does things a certain way it doesn't make it the right way. Self connect and educate yourself. This is the age of information. You have access to more information than you can actually process. Look across time and history and around the world, observe your options and how different people birth and raise babies. What makes sense to you?

* Babies need connection, milk, sleep and to potty. That's pretty much it. Safe co sleeping, breastfeeding, and babywearing and infant potty training are important for mama and babies bond, milk supply, and nervous systems.

- Mamas need support. A Postpartum doula is hugely under utilized in American society. Consider one.

* Don't focus too much on the stuff. You'll get what you need material wise for baby, focus on preparing physically, mentally and emotionally.

- If your baby is crying, there's a reason, try and figure out what it is. If your baby cries all the time, consider: tongue and lip ties, acid reflux, silent reflux, FPIES, dairy allergies.

* Nobody loves or knows your baby like you do, listen to yourself and your baby.
