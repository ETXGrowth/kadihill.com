<h1>About Kadi</h1>

<p>
	I'm Kadi Hill. I'm really into birth, breastfeeding, infant potty training, parenting, co-sleeping, baby wearing, hammocks, community, travel, family, philosophy, empathy, honesty, and connection.
</p>

<p>
	I never quite fit in any camp but rather like to travel from community to comunity to take the best from all worlds (I value things from indigenous communities in primitive settings, and also modern science and civilization). I'll keep you on your toes with unexpected opinions and observations.
