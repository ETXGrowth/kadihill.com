As parents we were many hats, we do many jobs, and we evolve for the role as our kids grow. My birdseye view of parenting is this: I have short term duties to keep my children alive, fed, and clean. Emotionally, physically and mentally looked after. The long term duties though are this: My job is to raise a child who feels safe, knows that he or she is loved, knows how to love, understands giving and recieving empathy and that we are a codependent species on a interconnected planet. My job is to raise a child that knows that they are a peice of the puzzle and not the center of anything. It is my duty to teach them to think for themselves, to think about others, and to know how to survive and thrive and contribute to their society.

As soon as my child knows how to do something for themselves that is my cue to stop doing it for him or her. At that point, I would be enabling, not helping. When my child can put food in their own mouth, I let them. When my daughter can put her own shoes on, I don't put them on anymore. When they can speak for themselves, I let them. The practice of letting your child do what they can for themselves builds confidence, self trust, problem solving skills, resilliance and autonomy. All things I want my child to be suffiecient in as an adult! It paints the world as full of possibilities, full of things to learn and understand, it allows them to interact with the world they are a part of rather than passivley experience it which makes for a pretty disgruntulted, ufullfilled human (at any age).

So, as a newborn or a baby, I will literally do everything for my child because they need me too. The fourth trimester is a time of connection, learning and bonding. It is an intimate time between mama and baby as mama gets to know baby and baby gets to know life outside the world. It is an intimate time between baby and daddy and other care takers as well, but always second to babies primary care taker, who biologically speaking is their mother optimally. If a biological mother is not present for any reason, than the babies loving and capable primary character is the most important bond being formed at this time. During this time, I will respond to all my babies cues, I will be in phystical contact with my baby through the majority of the day and night, holding, wearing, nursing, and sleeping together. I will know babies cries for when he or she is hungry or needs to potty or is ready for sleep and quiet. I will know if something is off or wrong and when to seek help. I will know all this because this baby will have my presence and attention and physical support.

As a toddler I will do significantly less. This is the "I can do it stage for a reason." Admittedly, it is very hard to practice this in a fast paced western lifestyle. I see it is much easier to apply in slower, paced village life. I say, practice it to whatever degree you can and balance it with teaching your child to listen to when you need to take over to keep the ship moving.

By 3 or 4 the self sufficiency of the child is luxuriously autonomous for both parent and child.

In a nutshell:

- If they can do it themselves I don't do it for them
- I lead, my children follow
- I teach them how to survive and thrive
- Everyone is a contributing member
- In our household everyone is treated with empathy, compassion, and respect
- Let them play
